----------------------------- Aggregated Profile per GPU -----------------------------
Top 1 modules in terms of params, MACs or fwd latency at different model depths:
depth 0:
    params      - {'Net': '62.01 K'}
    MACs        - {'Net': '5.21 MMACs'}
    fwd latency - {'Net': '1.11 ms'}

------------------------------ Detailed Profile per GPU ------------------------------
Each module profile is listed after its name in the following order: 
params, percentage of total params, MACs, percentage of total MACs, fwd latency, percentage of total fwd latency, fwd FLOPS

Note: 1. A module can have torch.nn.module or torch.nn.functional to compute logits (e.g. CrossEntropyLoss). They are not counted as submodules, thus not to be printed out. However they make up the difference between a parent's MACs (or latency) and the sum of its submodules'.
2. Number of floating-point operations is a theoretical estimation, thus FLOPS computed using that could be larger than the maximum system throughput.
3. The fwd latency listed in the top module's profile is directly captured at the module forward function in PyTorch, thus it's less than the fwd latency shown above which is captured in DeepSpeed.

Dia's Notes
- MACs is the number of multiplication and addition operations performed by a neural network model during inference or training.
- world size is the number of GPUs

Questions
- Why stage3 is not performing as it should be? Why model parallel size for stage3 is 1? Did I set any config worng?
- Why the forward propogation latency keeps increasing with stage number? communication time?
- Where to find GPU usage? or should I use nvidia-smi instead?￼Get access to the codebase.
￼Ask for the important parts of the code.
￼Review and understand the parts of the codebase. Make notes.
